        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> After highschool, like a lot of kids, I struggled deciding what I wanted to do for a career. Because I enjoy helping people I decided to go into EMS. In my down time at work I began to take online coding classes. It wasn't long until I decided I wanted to make developing software my full time career. </p>
        
        <p>I'm currently a software engineering student at Thinkful. I'm excited to be working on becoming a full time developer. I hope to use my new skills and knowledge to continue being able to help people.</p>

          <h3>My Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiking and Backpacking</li>
        <li>Exploring with my Dogs</li>
        <li>Fixing Cars</li>
        <li>Playing Piano</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>I'm always interested in fresh ideas so feel free to hit me up to talk or work together. If you are looking to hire a remote or Arizona based software developer <strong>Contact Me!</strong></p>
